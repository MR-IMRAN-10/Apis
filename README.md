# Media Download API and Simulation Service

This project provides an API with two key features:

1. **Media Download API**: Allows users to download media from a given URL.
2. **Simulation Service**: Interacts with an external API to simulate and return responses based on user queries.

## Features

- **Media Download API**: Extracts and returns download links from a given URL.
- **Simulation API**: Sends a user-provided query to an external simulation service and returns the response.

## Endpoints

### 1. `/api`

**Method**: `GET`

This endpoint allows users to download media by providing a URL.

#### Query Parameters:
- `url` (string, required): The URL from which media is to be downloaded.

#### Response:
- **Success**: Returns JSON data containing media download details (e.g., title, URL, file size).
- **Error**: 
  - **400**: If the `url` parameter is not provided.
  - **500**: If an error occurs while downloading media.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /api?url=https://example.com/video
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "title": "Video Title",
  "url": "https://example.com/video",
  "size": "100MB"
}
```

### 2. `/sim`

**Method**: `GET`

This endpoint sends a user query to an external simulation service and returns the response.

#### Query Parameters:
- `ask` (string, required): The question or query to be sent to the simulation service.

#### Response:
- **Success**: Returns a JSON response with the result from the external simulation service.
- **Error**:
  - **400**: If the `ask` parameter is not provided.
  - **500**: If there is an issue communicating with the external API.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /sim?ask=What is the capital of France?
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "response": "Paris"
}
```

## Dependencies

- **express**: Web framework for Node.js used to handle HTTP requests.
- **imran-dlmedia**: A library used to download media from a URL.
- **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the API call to the external simulation service.
- **path**: Used to handle file and directory paths.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `Failed to download media`
This error occurs when the `alldl` function fails to retrieve data from the given URL. Ensure that the URL is valid and accessible.

### Error: `Failed to get response from external API`
This error indicates that the external simulation API (hosted at `http://5.9.12.94:14642/sim`) is either down or unreachable. Check the status of the external service.

### Notes:
- Replace the placeholder `https://github.com/MR-IMRAN-60/Apis.git` with your actual GitHub repository URL.
- The **External API** referenced in the `/sim` endpoint (`http://5.9.12.94:14642/sim`) may be unreliable, so ensure the API is functional and properly documented.
